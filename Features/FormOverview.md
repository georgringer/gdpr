Each form must be checked if it complies with the GDPR. This can't be done by the extension but it can help to ease the workflow.

## Features

- Listing of all forms, generated by the most popular form extensions `form`, `powermail` & `formhandler:
- Provide a state to know which forms have already been checked and which need to be done.

## Configuration

No configuration required. If one of the supported form extensions is installed, all content elements showing forms are rendered.
